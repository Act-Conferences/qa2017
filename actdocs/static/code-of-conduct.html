<h2>Perl QA Hackathon 2017 Code of Conduct</h2>

<p>
The Perl QA Hackathon is dedicated to providing a harassment-free hackathon experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of hackathon participants in any form. hackathon participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the hackathon at the discretion of the hackathon organizers.
</p>

<p>
Harassment includes verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion; sexual images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation; stalking; following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
</p>

<p>
If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the hackathon organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the hackathon. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of hackathon staff immediately. hackathon staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the hackathon. We value your attendance.
