<h2>Support the hackathon</h2>

<p>If you want to support the hackathon and the projects that we will
work on, you can make a donation.
Any money not used for this hackathon will go to the organizers of the
next hackathon.</p>

<h3>How?</h3>

<p>As we all benefit from the work done by these volunteers, this event is entirely paid for through sponsorship and donations.
If your company uses Perl, maybe you could ask them to contribute? Alternatively, if you wish to as an individual, would like to donate, you can.</p>

<p>Donations can be made via the <strong><em>Enlightened Perl Organisation</em></strong> (EPO):</p>
<p><a href="https://members.enlightenedperl.org/drupal/donate-perlqa?id=6">https://members.enlightenedperl.org/drupal/donate-perlqa?id=6</a></p>

<p>If your company needs invoicing for sponsorship, or a larger donation, let us know and the EPO will bill you.
An invoice can be selected from the online portal for those who use that route.</p>
